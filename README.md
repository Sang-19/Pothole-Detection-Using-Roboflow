An intelligent pothole detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify and analyze potholes in images. This project leverages Roboflow's API for accurate object detection and provides detailed analysis of detected potholes.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Pothole Detection**: Identifies potholes in images with high accuracy
- **Confidence-based Filtering**: Adjustable confidence thresholds for optimal detection
- **Visualization**: Draws bounding boxes around detected potholes
- **Multiple Image Support**: Process multiple images in a single run
- **Optimization**: Automatically finds optimal confidence levels for best results

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Roboflow API key (Get yours from [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pothole-detection.git
   cd pothole-detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your Roboflow API key to the script or set it as an environment variable.

### Usage

1. Place your images in the project directory
2. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python detection.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Process all images in the directory
   - Save results as `improved_<original_filename>.png`
   - Display detections with confidence scores

## 📊 Output

The script provides detailed output including:
- Number of potholes detected
- Confidence scores for each detection
- Visual representation with bounding boxes
- Optimized confidence threshold used

## 🤖 How It Works

The detection system:
1. Takes input images
2. Sends them to Roboflow's API for object detection
3. Processes the response to identify potholes
4. Draws bounding boxes around detected potholes
5. Saves and displays the results
